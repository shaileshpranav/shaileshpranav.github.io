## Professional Experience
### New York University – Tandon School of Engineering – Mechatronics, Control and Robotics Lab
- Designed and fabricated a rehabilitation device specifically tailored for stroke patients who had partial loss of maneuverability of their arms.

### L.G. Balakrishnan & Bros Ltd – Automation Intern
- Developed and deployed a custom data logging system to accurately track and analyze production output of individual machines.
- Leveraged expertise in cloud computing to design and implement a cloud-based database, streamlining inventory management and facilitating real-time production planning

## Certification
- Google IT Support Specialist

## Academic Projects
### Self-Driving Vehicle Traversing a Dynamic Environment [GitHub](https://github.com/shaileshpranav/ENPM-690/tree/master/Final_Project)
- Used Vision Transformer for generating a trajectory for a vehicle moving along a dynamic environment.
- Visualized by using Lyft's gym environment.
- Dataset used is Lyft's Level5 planning dataset.

### Depth-Estimation using a Monocular Camera
- Using a transformer-based architecture to divide the input RGB image into bins whose center value is adaptively estimated, and the depth image is obtained by a linear combination of the values.

### Challenge of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) for Autonomous Robots [GitHub](https://github.com/shaileshpranav/US-R-challenge)
- Simulated a system wherein a pair of robots are used for the purpose of search and rescue in urban environments.
- The lead robot moves along the map to a list of positions at which an AR tag is used to signify the presence of a victim. The second robot receives the location of the victims and the order in which the rescue is to be carried out.

### Trash Detection and Collection Robot in an unknown environment [GitHub](https://github.com/shaileshpranav/Wall-E.git)
- Designed and simulated a robot capable of traversing an unknown environment.
- The robot can detect any object using its cameras and deliver it to a pre-specified goal position.

### Autonomous Car for Indian roads
- Contributed to the development of a computer vision system for lane and traffic signal detection using Yolo v4.
- Successfully interfaced Velodyne LIDAR with the system for enhanced accuracy.

### Maze solver using Depth First Search Algorithm [GitHub](https://github.com/shaileshpranav/MazeSolver-using-DFS)
- A robot moves through a maze by making use of the Depth First Search Algorithm.
- The micro mouse simulator is used for the purpose of generating a maze as well as for visualizing the robot in real time.

## Leadership Experience
- TIDES Conference: I volunteered as an organizer for the TIDES Leadership Summit, which was conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry. During this event, I assisted in coordinating logistics, managing attendees, and ensuring the smooth execution of various sessions and activities. 
- ENEXT: As the team lead for the console at the prestigious E-NEXT Conference hosted by the Entrepreneurs Club of PSG College of Technology, I successfully managed and coordinated a team of highly skilled individuals to ensure seamless execution of the event, contributing to its overall success.
- KRIYA – Intercollege Technical Fest: As the convener for the technical event MEMOBOT, I successfully organized and managed a maze solver and memory-based path planner competition. My responsibilities included coordinating with teams, designing the competition rules, and overseeing the event logistics.

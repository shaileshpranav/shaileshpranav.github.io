## Academic Projects
### Self-Driving Vehicle Traversing a Dynamic Environment (GitHub)
- Used Vision Transformer for generating a trajectory for a vehicle moving along a dynamic environment.
- Visualized by using Lyft's gym environment.
- Dataset used is Lyft's Level5 planning dataset.

### Depth-Estimation using a Monocular Camera
- Using a transformer-based architecture to divide the input RGB image into bins whose center value is adaptively estimated, and the depth image is obtained by a linear combination of the values.

### Challenge of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) for Autonomous Robots (GitHub)
- Simulated a system wherein a pair of robots are used for the purpose of search and rescue in urban environments.
- The lead robot moves along the map to a list of positions at which an AR tag is used to signify the presence of a victim. The second robot receives the location of the victims and the order in which the rescue is to be carried out.

### Trash Detection and Collection Robot in an unknown environment (GitHub)
- Designed and simulated a robot capable of traversing an unknown environment.
- The robot can detect any object using its cameras and deliver it to a pre-specified goal position.

### Autonomous Car for Indian roads
- Self-driving car being developed as a part of the Mahindra RISE Driverless Car Challenge competition.
- Worked on computer vision for lane and traffic signal detection and LIDAR Interfacing.

### Maze solver using Depth First Search Algorithm (GitHub)
- A robot moves through a maze by making use of the Depth First Search Algorithm.
- The micro mouse simulator is used for the purpose of generating a maze as well as for visualizing the robot in real time.
